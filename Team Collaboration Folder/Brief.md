# Pub/Store Finder

Global pub giant Withoutaspoon, wants a pub finder that allows users to "Find your nearest pub" for their website.

Users should be able to enter their postcode or town or street name and get a list of the top ten nearest pubs. Each pub should have a distance, address, phone number, opening hours and a list of facilities and services (e.g. cash machine, car parking).

You'll have to build your own API to persist the pub data and use an external API to find addresses from postcodes.

For an example, look at  http://bit.ly/2ndRL75

## MVP

- Search by postcode or town or street name.
- A list of pubs including the details of the pubs.
- A map marking the pubs.
- Use Geolocation to allow users to "use current location" to find pubs.
