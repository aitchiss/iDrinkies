# iDrinkies

The brief for this group project was create a stockist locator for an independent brewer (iDrinkies).
The app fulfils the brief with:

- a GoogleMap showing the location of all stockists
- markers indicating the location of stockists
- info windows on markers showing stockist details and distance from the user's current location
- search box (with autocomplete) allowing search by street, area, postcode
- button to use current location to find stockists
- expanding and collapsing information list 

### Technology used

- vanilla JavaScript
- MongoDB for persistence of stockist information
- local API to serve up stockist information
- GoogleMaps API including use of Places and DistanceMatrix libraries
